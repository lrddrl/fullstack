Frontend Development:
I will use React as the frontend library to create the product listing page.
I will use Axios to fetch the product data from the PHP API endpoint.

Backend Development:
I will use the Slim Framework as the PHP backend framework to create the API endpoint.
I will assume that the product data is stored in a database and will use a simple database connection. 



Assumptions:
The PHP API endpoint is already set up with the necessary routes and configurations.
The product data in the database is already populated and accessible via the PHP API.


server : 
prot: 8080
start sever:
php -S localhost:8080

backend
(PS C:\full stack\fullstack\backend\public> php -S localhost:8080)
frontend
(PS C:\full stack\fullstack\website> npm start)

backend: http://localhost:8080
frontend: http://localhost:3000

Use proxy for frontend to test fake data.
