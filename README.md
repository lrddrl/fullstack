Frontend Development:
I will use React as the frontend library to create the product listing page.
I will use Axios to fetch the product data from the PHP API endpoint.
I will create a grid component that dynamically populates the products based on the fetched data.
I will implement the responsive design using CSS media queries, displaying 4 products per row on larger screens and 2 products per row on smaller screens.
I will add a click event handler to each product item to navigate the user to a product detail page. Since the detail page implementation is not required, I will simply console log the clicked product's ID for now.

Backend Development:
I will use the Slim Framework as the PHP backend framework to create the API endpoint.
I will create a route /products with the GET method that returns the product data in JSON format.
I will assume that the product data is stored in a database and will use a simple database connection. 

Additional Features:
I will add the ability to add and remove products to/from a cart.
I will implement sorting and filtering options for the products based on certain criteria.
I will optimize the webpack bundling configuration for better performance and code splitting.

Assumptions:
The PHP API endpoint is already set up with the necessary routes and configurations.
The product data in the database is already populated and accessible via the PHP API.
The basic HTML structure and CSS styles for the product grid and other components are already in place.

server : 
prot: 8080
start sever:
php -S localhost:8080

(PS C:\full stack\fullstack\backend\public> php -S localhost:8080)

backend: http://localhost:8080
frontend: http://localhost:3000

Use proxy for frontend to test fake data.
